## Sections

### Users
You are going to have the possibility to manage Users, create and delete them in order to have an organized website.
### Products
Any E-Commerce should have the possibility to manage the stock products, being able to create a product, update stock of available products and delete them if needed.
### Orders
Another important thing on an E-Commerce website is being able to manage orders so you can ship them as fast as possible. This Admin Panel is able to manage any order.
### Delivery
Being able to track the sippings is as important as organizing the orders, so having a section to track the packages is a must.
